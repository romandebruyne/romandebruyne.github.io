## Data Science Portfolio of Roman Hetterle

### Introduction

This portfolio is a compilation of code (primarily stored in Jupyter notebooks) which I created for data science projects, including e.g. Kaggle competitions or mini-projects on Codecademy or Udemy. Moreover, the portfolio contains code related to personal projects.
