## Data Science Portfolio of Roman Hetterle

### Introduction

This portfolio is a compilation of code (primarily stored in Jupyter notebooks) which I created for data science projects, including e.g. Kaggle competitions or mini-projects on Codecademy or Udemy. Moreover, the portfolio contains code related to personal projects.

### Table of Contents

#### Kaggle Competitions:

1. **House Prices**: regression problem; using house features to predict the final sales price.
2. **Titanic Survivors**: classification problem; classify passengers that survived the Titanic's sinking.
3. **Digit Recognizer**: classification problem; applying classification models to recognize digits.
