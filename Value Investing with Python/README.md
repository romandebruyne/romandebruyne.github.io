## Value Investing with Python (VIPy)

This part of the portfolio is dedicated to an own project called **Value Investing with Python** (in short: **VIPy**). The project's aim is to design a **semi-automated process** that is able to **evaluate stocks/companies** in accordance to the **value investing philosophy**. To construct such a process, the project encompasses functions to **gather, modify and evaluate stock/company data**. For each function a single Jupyter notebook will be provided.
