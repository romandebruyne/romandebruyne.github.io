## Value Investing with Python (VIPy)

This part of the portfolio is dedicated to a personal project called **Value Investing with Python** (in short: **VIPy**). The project's aim is to design a **semi-automated process** that is able to **evaluate stocks/companies** in accordance to the **value investing philosophy**. To construct such a process, the project encompasses functions to **gather, modify and evaluate stock/company data**. For each function a single Jupyter notebook will be provided. Please note that all notebooks are linked to each other (i.e. the output of the one is in some cases required as input in another notebook).
