## Value Investing with Python

This part of the portfolio is dedicated to an own project. The project's aim is to design a semi-automated proces that is able to evaluate stocks/companies in accordance to the value investing philosophy. To construct such a process, the project encompasses functions to gather, modify and evaluate stock/company data. For each function a single Jupyter notebook will be provided.
