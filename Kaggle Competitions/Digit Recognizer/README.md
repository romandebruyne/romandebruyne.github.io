## Digit Recognizer (Kaggle Competition)

The code in this notebook was created to participate in the **Digit Recognizer** competition on kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data). The competition's goal is to predict/recognize digits using pixel data and classification models, ranging from simple linear models to tree-based models like the Random Forest Classifier.

All data used in the notebook is available on the competition webpage.
